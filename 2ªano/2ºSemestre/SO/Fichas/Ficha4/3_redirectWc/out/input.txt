We on the quest with the tribe (I bought it)

Better not fuck up the vibe (It's Travis)
Runnin' this shit with a stride
You know my gang the flyest

I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain, duckin' boys in the blue (Zoo)
I see you holdin' out on my change, I'm needin' all of the loot (Ching-ching)
When I'm ridin' off on my side, best believe I got the scoop (Scoop)

Whole squad goin' up, JACKBOYS on the loose (Yeah, yeah, bitch)

Now we can go make the millions, Trinidad my crew
Cactus Jack on my shoe
And this shit
I came from the mud, straight to the top (Yeah)
Shooters outside double parked

Young nigga rich, but I'm still from the trenches (Woo)
Luxury Tax, my water by G

I'm passin' out pills, I'ma geek up the VIP (Yeah)
One shot to the head and make sure he don't miss
I fuck on the bitch, have her stalkin' on Fifth
Still pourin' up Act', they say it don't exist (At all)
Fifth got some vibes at the crib
Like, "I wanna fuck right now"
Keep hundred on hundreds for real
Bitch, I'm goin' up right now
Bitch rollin' some weed, you know gang in the stu'
Bottles on bottles, 1942
Models on models, this shit nothin' new
You might catch some shots takin' shots at the crew
I like my hoes by the two
Blew 800K on a coupe (Uh-huh, racks)
We fucked, it wasn't nothin' else to do (Ooh)
You play with La Flame, I'ma shoot (Racks)
This a hundred round drum, I got mob ties
This a double M truck, ain't no broke vibes
Now we only take jets for the hard times
Know I call up them killers, they gon' slide
Bitch, I'm with the gang
[Chorus: Don Toliver, Sheck Wes & Luxury Tax]
I'm with the gang, gang, gang, gang, BOYS hoppin' out of coupes (Gang)
I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain, duckin' boys in the blue (Bitch)
I see you holdin' out on my change, I'm needin' all of the loot (Ching-ching)
